# Sentencer
This Windows application makes it easy to read two documents side-by-side sentence-by-sentence. With the same novel in two different languages it makes language learning easy and fun. 

How to use before setup. 
In order to make Sentencer work it has to be prepared. 
1.  place "upper.txt" and "lower.txt" next to Sentencer.exe. 
2.  "sentencer_config.txt" holds sentence pointers in upper and lower texts. This file is updated upn exit. Next time Sentencer launched it picks up automatically where reading was left off. 
3. "ReadLog.txt" is updated when a sentence pair is created. Once a book is finished reading or whenever "p" is pressed a Kindle mobi book is created. Based on the sentence pairs recorded in this file. 

This appliction is still under construction.
